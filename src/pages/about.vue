          My name is Yasmin Zulfati Yusrina. I am 26 years old and I live in
          Samarinda, Indonesia. I started learning to code after I graduated
          from Institut Teknologi Kalimantan in 2016. In 2018, I started making
          Vue tutorials on
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/c/YasminZulfatiYusrina"
          >YouTube</a>
          and my website.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also worked as a front-end web developer in Jakarta for a bit before
          I continued my study at Institut Teknologi Bandung. I got so busy and
          barely ever coded.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I dive back to web development recently (I finally graduated),
          everything has changed ðŸ¤£ It is still fun, though, so I decided to
          rebuild my website and make Vue tutorials again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides web development, I am also interested in intermittent fasting
          and exercise. I used to jog a few times a week before Covid-19, but
          now I like jumping rope more. I also like playing games and reading
          webtoon.
